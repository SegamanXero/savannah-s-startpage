# Savannah's Startpage
A startpage I hacked together that has some most used links that my little princess visits. Designed in mind with touch screen usage. Target device is a Kano laptop running a Intel Celeron running the Microsoft Edge browser. Was developed and tested on Min browser and Firefox, should run on other things as it should be simple.

# Usage/Installation
I guess can be installed locally, but maybe will setup on the web somewhere.

# Additional info
Additional info can be found in the information folder including a prototype mockup, links to the souces used, licence for the metaballs.js, and kid friendly links that are used in this startpage. Everything else would fall under the MIT licence.

# Todo
Take over the world.
